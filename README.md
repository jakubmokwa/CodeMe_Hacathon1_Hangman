"# CodeMe_Hacathon1_Hangman" 
Implementation of "School" game Hangman for 1 player against the computer.
Program randomly chooses word from static list (to be changed in future)
for player to guess by typing letters or whole words.
Code uses lists as a main data structure, as it's easier to change single letters with given index.
